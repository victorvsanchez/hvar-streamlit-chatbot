# HR Chatbot

A simple customized Q&A Chatbot that answers domain-specific questions related to a company's HR, such as vacation policy, laws on days off, employee benefits, among others. It includes a simple login system, using [streamlit-authenticator](https://github.com/mkhorasani/Streamlit-Authenticator), a monitoring board to keep track and evaluate questions answered, and a panel for analysis and metrics related to its use.

This app was originally deployed in a GCP Compute Engine instance running a dockerized [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) application. It was meant to be easily connected to a backend server on a next step, to actually store new message data, as well as allow the retrieval of personal information of the user from a database.
